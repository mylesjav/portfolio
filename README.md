## Work Portfolio

This project was an exercise in incorporating HTML and CSS for a work portfolio.  This portfolio contains placeholders for future projects that can be presented to a potential employer.  A concept that I had learned while working on this were flexbox.  My grasp on flexbox is still in the beginning phases.
